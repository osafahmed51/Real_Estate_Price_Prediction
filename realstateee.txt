df3['bhk']=df3['size'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split(' ')[0]))

this will split size values , that are in two types integars and strings
. with these two values it is difficult to make predictions so this lambda with split
fucntion will split it, [0] means first value .

-------------------------------------------------------
location is a categorial data but here we are training regression model
that is why too much location values will create some problems .
we will make location values less as much as we can.


df5.location=df5.location.apply(lambda x: x.strip())
this strip() will remove all the extra spaces from our location column
